Logic: 

On click button: 
    Check if user has already clicked on any option button

        If not then:

            Make all the option buttons go blue
            After that, get the option you chose's data from the database
            Increment the selected option
            Display the results by getting all of the information from the database

            Save it to all the databases, the totalPosts one, the userPosts one, and finally the idPosts one
        
        If yes:
            Don't do anything

TODO: 

Fix database structure to include the option count
First make the button do something
Then import the database (all of them)
Then get the chosen options data
Display it on the option button (i.e: 1)
Get all of the options data, and save the increment given
Save it to all the databases.
