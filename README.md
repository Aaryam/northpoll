# northpoll


NorthPoll is a website where someone can send and answer to polls.
Built on the backend framework, Firebase made by Google, it ensures uptime.
As a starting Firebase project for me, there will be bugs, however I feel like this website is truly a great concept.
I want to, and will update the website. Hopefully frequently as well.
As of now I am working on the website responsiveness and the UX design.

I really hope that the website I am building is as great as I envision it to be.
Thanks, Aaryam
